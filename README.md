# elobot
Simple Discord bot implementing the aoe2.net API

This project provides a python interface to the aoe2.net API.

As a starting point, you also get a simple bot that allows to search for AoE2:DE players and returns their current Elo rating. 
More features can be implemented, I'm looking forward to your pull requests.

You can test my running bot. Invite it to your discord:

(Link is of May 2020, no clue how long I'll host this.)
