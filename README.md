# EloBot
A simple Discord bot implementing the aoe2.net API

### About
This project provides a python interface to the aoe2.net API. 
This bot is not affiliated with aoe2net, it just uses the open API they provide.

As a starting point, you also get a simple bot that allows to search for AoE2:DE players and returns their current Elo rating. 
More features can be implemented, I'm looking forward to getting your pull requests.

You can test my running bot: [Invite EloBot to your discord](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=707630937252298864&permissions=19456&scope=bot)
